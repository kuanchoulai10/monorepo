# How OpenTelemetry Works?

For a system to be observable, it must be **instrumented**: that is, code from the system's components must emit [signals](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/), such as [traces](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces/), [metrics](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/metrics/), and [logs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/logs/).

Using OpenTelemetry, you can instrument your code in two primary ways:

- [Code-based solutions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/instrumentation/code-based/) via official [APIs and SDKs for most languages](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/). This acts as an **essential complement** to the telemetry generated by zero-code solutions.
- [Zero-code solutions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/instrumentation/zero-code/) are great for getting started, or when you can't modify the application you need to get telemetry out of.

See [Instrumentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/instrumentation/) for more details.

## Core Concepts


### [**Signals**](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/)

Signals are system outputs that describe the underlying activity of the operating system and applications running on a platform. It includes three primary types: logs, metrics, and traces.

### [**Span**](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces/#spans)

A span represents a unit of work or operation. Spans are the building blocks of Traces.

### [**Traces**](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces)

Traces give us the big picture of what happens when a request is made to an application. One way to think of Traces is that they're a collection of structured logs with context, correlation, hierarchy, and more baked in.

```

        [Span A]  ←←←(the root span)
            |
     +------+------+
     |             |
 [Span B]      [Span C] ←←←(Span C is a `child` of Span A)
     |             |
 [Span D]      +---+-------+
               |           |
           [Span E]    [Span F]
```

### [**Metrics**](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/metrics/)

A metric is a measurement of a service captured at runtime. The moment of capturing a measurement is known as a metric event

```
+------------------+
| MeterProvider    |                 +-----------------+             +--------------+
|   Meter A        | Measurements... |                 | Metrics...  |              |
|     Instrument X +-----------------> In-memory state +-------------> MetricReader |
|     Instrument Y |                 |                 |             |              |
|   Meter B        |                 +-----------------+             +--------------+
|     Instrument Z |
|     ...          |                 +-----------------+             +--------------+
|     ...          | Measurements... |                 | Metrics...  |              |
|     ...          +-----------------> In-memory state +-------------> MetricReader |
|     ...          |                 |                 |             |              |
|     ...          |                 +-----------------+             +--------------+
+------------------+
```

### [**Logs**](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/logs/)

A log is a timestamped text record, either structured (recommended) or unstructured, with optional metadata. OpenTelemetry's support for logs is designed to be fully compatible with what you already have, providing capabilities to wrap those logs with additional context and a common toolkit to parse and manipulate logs into a common format across many different sources.

### [**Baggage**](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/baggage/)

Baggage is often used in tracing to propagate additional data across services. Additionally, instrumentations automatically propagate baggage for you. Baggage is best used to include information typically available only at the start of a request further downstream (Account ID, User ID, Product ID, origin IPs, etc.)

*[Meter Provider]: A Meter Provider (sometimes called `MeterProvider`) is a factory for `Meter`s. In most applications, a Meter Provider is initialized once and its lifecycle matches the application's lifecycle.
*[Meter]: A Meter creates Metric Instruments, capturing measurements about a service at runtime. Meters are created from Meter Providers.
*[Metric Exporter]: Metric Exporters send metric data to a consumer.
*[Metric Instruments]: In OpenTelemetry measurements are captured by metric instruments. A metric instrument is defined by name, kind (counter, gauge, histogram, etc.), unit, and description.
 

*[Tracer Provider]: A Tracer Provider (sometimes called TracerProvider) is a factory for Tracers. In most applications, a Tracer Provider is initialized once and its lifecycle matches the application’s lifecycle.
*[Tracer]: A Tracer creates spans containing more information about what is happening for a given operation, such as a request in a service. Tracers are created from Tracer Providers.
*[Trace Exporters]: Trace Exporters send traces to a consumer.
