# Industry Analyst Intern, ITRI

!!! abstract "Summary"

    - [x] Researched and analyzed the 7 key roles (DSP, SSP, DMP etc.) within the "AdTech industry", using "eLand Information", a leading AI & Data Analytics company in Taiwan, as a case study to predict future industry trends and propose strategies.
    - [x] Analyzed technical trends within the cloud services industry, contributing to the authorship of 2 research articles on the subject.
    - [x] Systematized and summarized 100+ benchmark cases in the 4 major domains of IoT â€“ water resources, air quality, earthquakes, and disaster prevention.


The Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), established in 1973 in Taiwan, is a leading applied research organization with over 6,500 experts driving industrial development and innovation. Known for pioneering advancements like integrated circuits and incubating companies such as TSMC and UMC, ITRI has shaped Taiwan's industrial landscape with over 30,000 patents. Focused on Smart Living, Quality Health, Sustainable Environment, and Resilient Society, ITRI addresses global challenges like digital transformation, demographic shifts, and climate change through its "2035 Technology Strategy and Blueprint," fostering solutions that enhance lives and industries.

During my time at ITRI, I was part of the interdisciplinary research team at the Industrial Economics and Knowledge Center (IEK). My work primarily revolved around studying the data economy, with a particular focus on the **AdTech industry**. I delved into the key roles within the ecosystem, such as Demand Side Platforms (DSP), Supply Side Platforms (SSP), and Data Management Platforms (DMP). Additionally, I explored technical trends in the **IoT sector**, analyzing over 100 benchmark cases across four major domains: water resources, air quality, earthquakes, and disaster prevention. These research efforts were aimed at predicting future industry trends and proposing actionable strategies.

One of the most valuable lessons I learned at ITRI is that **studying industry trends requires a holistic approach**. It's not just about understanding the technology; you also need to consider business models, policies, and socio-cultural factors. This experience inspired me to dive deeper into the world of data science. While researching companies in the data-driven space, I realized how much I enjoyed working with data and uncovering insights. This journey has been both challenging and rewarding, and it has shaped my aspirations for the future.
