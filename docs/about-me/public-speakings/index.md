# Public Speakings

Sharing knowledge and ideas with others is something I value deeply. Here, you can find my past speaking engagements, talks, and presentations, along with topics I'm passionate about. I'm always open to new opportunities to connect and speak.

## [Taipei dbt Meetup #27](https://www.meetup.com/taipei-dbt-meetup/events/302432145/)

In this talk, presented to an audience of around 100 attendees, I explored three key aspects of implementing dbt: people, process, and pipelines. From the people perspective, I discussed the challenges within data teams, such as the division of responsibilities between data engineers and analysts, which often creates bottlenecks. I also highlighted organizational challenges, like the lack of accountability for data quality in cross-functional teams, and how dbt helps address these issues by fostering collaboration and domain-oriented modeling.

From the pipeline perspective, I shared how dbt simplifies complex workflows by leveraging tools like Jinja SQL and Google Cloud's BigQuery remote functions, enabling a unified and maintainable pipeline. Lastly, I touched on infrastructure challenges, particularly the need to manage separate repositories for Terraform and dbt, and how integrating these repositories can streamline workflows despite some trade-offs. Overall, the talk emphasized how dbt can transform data workflows and improve collaboration across teams.

I'm thrilled to have had the opportunity to share and exchange ideas with like-minded individuals during this event. Engaging in discussions and learning from others is always an enriching experience.


## [DevOpsDays Taipei 2024](https://devopsdays.tw/2024/session-page/3025)

In this talk, presented to an audience of over 300 attendees, I shared how TVBS approaches DataOps and the foundational principles behind its architecture design: data democracy, bridging the gap between data engineers and analysts, and bringing code to data. 

I also discussed the four competitive advantages of our ELT approach: ease of maintenance, a focus on high-value activities, reducing technical gaps, and leveraging a large, mature community. 

For those interested in a deeper dive, I recommend exploring the following publications:

It was an incredible experience to share these insights and engage with such a large and enthusiastic audience. 聽眾的回饋和互動讓這次演講更加充實和有意義。
