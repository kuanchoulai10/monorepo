# âœ¨ About Me

Hi, I'm *KC*. I'm a *Data Engineer* focused on *building large-scale, distributed, data-intensive platforms that are scalable, fault-tolerant, and evolvable on Kubernetes*{ .orange }. If you're going to work with me, this little guide will help you get a sense of how I communicate, collaborate, and show up at work.

## ðŸŒ± What I Value

- *Ownership: I take responsibility for business outcomes, not just technical tasks.*{ .orange } For example, I volunteered to own a data domain end-to-endâ€”from gathering requirements and building pipelines to delivering dashboards and running A/B tests. This proactive approach helped teams make data-driven product decisions faster.
- *Collaboration: I believe diverse perspectives lead to stronger solutions.*{ .orange } At a media company, I led a small cross-functional growth team that designed low-cost, high-impact experiments and built a clear metric system around the North Star goal. This alignment enabled editors and engineers to work toward shared targets with measurable impact.
- *Transparency: I value clear communication and knowledge sharing.*{ .orange } With a background in psychology and business, I translate technical concepts into language non-technical teams like marketing and editorial can understand. I also give internal tech talks on tools such as dbt, Terraform, and MLOps, which improved cross-team alignment and adoption.
- *Growth: I seek environments that encourage continuous learning and improvement.*{ .orange } I've pursued self-learning in machine learning and algorithms since grad school, and later introduced dbt and Terraform into production in the company. These initiatives not only advanced my own skills but also modernized the team's workflow, reducing manual effort and improving reliability.

## ðŸš€ My Strengths

Here are three areas where I think I bring the most value:

1. *Data Infrastructure & Lakehouse Expertise*{ .orange }: I have solid experience in building scalable, highly available data platforms and lakehouse architectures, and in choosing the right technology to support both team and organizational needs.
2. *Cross-functional Collaboration*{ .orange }: With a background in psychology and business management, I work well with colleagues from diverse disciplines.
3. *Learning Fast and Navigating Ambiguity*{ .orange }: I'm comfortable figuring out what matters most when requirements are unclear, and driving progress toward long-term goals.

## ðŸ’¬ Communication Style

- When dealing with complex problems, I prefer to **think things through first**, gather enough context, and then move into discussion. That way the conversation is clearer and everyone has the same foundation to build on.
- I prefer to start with **written communication**, since it gives both of us space to think, document ideas, and avoid missing details. When things get more complex, I appreciate **direct conversations**, whether online or in person.
- I also like to use **diagrams and drawings** to clarify ideas visually.
- I love sharing articles or resources that can help us get on the same page, so please **don't hesitate to ask me to share what I have or share anything useful you find**.

If you want to reach me:

- **Work messages**: I usually reply **within 2 hours**.
- **Email**: I'm slower.
- **Urgent matters**: You can find me on **LinkedIn**.

Also, I enjoy a bit of **small talk** at the beginning of a conversation. As someone from Taiwan, small talk isn't part of our culture, so I'm still practicing. If I seem a little awkward at first, please know it's not that I don't care. I'm learning, and **I truly value genuine human connection**.

## ðŸ•’ My Rhythm

- I currently based in **Taiwan** and **UST (UTC+8)** is my timezone.
- My peak focus time is usually **10:30 AM to 4:30 PM** on weekdays.
- On weekends, you'll often find me tinkering with personal projects.


## ðŸ™Œ Feedback

I welcome feedback, and I see it as a gift.

The style I appreciate most is **gentle but honest**. Tell me directly what could be improved, with no need to sugar-coat it. Constructive feedback helps me grow and I genuinely value it.


## ðŸŽ¶ Outside of Work

Outside of work, I'm passionate about **dance and music**. I used to do **popping (street dance)**, and later shifted to **Hustle partner dance**. Dancing gives me pure joy.

I also listen to a lot of music: **Jazz, Soul, Funk, Disco, Hip-hop, R\&B, and Neo Soul** are my go-tos. If you're into music or dancing, let's hang out sometime!
