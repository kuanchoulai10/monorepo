# âœ¨ About Me

Hi, I'm *KC*. I'm a *Data Engineer* focused on *building large-scale, distributed, data-intensive platforms that are scalable, fault-tolerant, and evolvable on Kubernetes*. If you're going to work with me, this little guide will help you get a sense of how I communicate, collaborate, and show up at work.



## ðŸ’¬ Communication Style

- I prefer to start with **written communication**, since it gives both of us space to think, document ideas, and avoid missing details. When things get more complex, I appreciate **direct conversations**, whether online or in person.
- I also like to use **diagrams and drawings** to clarify ideas visually.
- I love sharing articles or resources that can help us get on the same page, so please **don't hesitate to ask me to share what I have or share anything useful you find**.

If you want to reach me:

- **Work messages**: I usually reply **within 2 hours**.
- **Email**: I'm slower.
- **Urgent matters**: You can find me on **LinkedIn**.

Also, I enjoy a bit of **small talk** at the beginning of a conversation. As someone from Taiwan, small talk isn't part of our culture, so I'm still practicing. If I seem a little awkward at first, please know it's not that I don't care. I'm learning, and **I truly value genuine human connection**.



## ðŸ•’ My Rhythm

- I currently based in **Taiwan** and **UST (UTC+8)** is my timezone ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼.
- My peak focus time is usually **10:30 AM to 4:30 PM** on weekdays.
- On weekends, you'll often find me tinkering with personal projects.



## ðŸ§  How I Work

When dealing with complex problems, I prefer to **think things through first**, gather enough context, and then move into discussion. That way the conversation is clearer and everyone has the same foundation to build on.



## ðŸ™Œ Feedback

I welcome feedback, and I see it as a gift.

The style I appreciate most is **gentle but honest**. Tell me directly what could be improved, with no need to sugar-coat it. Constructive feedback helps me grow and I genuinely value it.



## ðŸš€ My Strengths

Here are three areas where I think I bring the most value:

1. **Data Pipelines Expertise**: I have solid experience in building data pipelines and choosing the right technology for the team's and organization's context.
2. **Cross-functional Collaboration**: With a background in psychology and business management, I work well with colleagues from diverse disciplines.
3. **Learning Fast and Navigating Ambiguity**: I'm comfortable figuring out what matters most when requirements are unclear, and driving progress toward long-term goals.


## ðŸŽ¶ Outside of Work

Outside of work, I'm passionate about **dance and music**. I used to do **popping (street dance)**, and later shifted to **Hustle partner dance**. Dancing gives me pure joy.

I also listen to a lot of music: **Jazz, Soul, Funk, Disco, Hip-hop, R\&B, and Neo Soul** are my go-tos. If you're into music or dancing, let's hang out sometime!
