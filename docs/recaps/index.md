# Monthly Recaps

Each month, I focus on learning specific technology domains and document my learning journey and outcomes. This practice helps me systematically master important skills while sharing my insights to grow together with the community.

Through monthly reviews, I can track my progress, maintain learning momentum, and prepare for future technical challenges.
