# Standup Meeting

!!! 

我昨天早上有跟 Jim 稍微對過一次，了解到他目前仍在負責 Backend API 的部分。因為不想兩個人同時做同一件事，所以我後來先去處理 CD pipeline。

昨天的實作已經大致完成，可以正常從 Application Insights 讀取 message，並送到 Storage Queue。今天會把這部分整合進 CD pipeline 裡。

如果沒有意外的話，今天應該可以繼續往下進行。我也打算今天再跟Jim sync 一下，看看是否有合作方式可以加快目前這個 task 的進度。

Yesterday morning, I had a quick sync with Jim. I realized that he's still working on the backend API part. To avoid duplicate work, I decided to work on the CD pipeline instead.

By yesterday, I had most of the implementation done. The program can now read messages from Application Insights and send them to the Storage Queue. Today, I'll integrate this part into the CD pipeline code.

If everything goes smoothly, I should be able to continue with the next steps today. I also plan to sync up with Jim again to see how we can collaborate and speed up the progress of this task.
