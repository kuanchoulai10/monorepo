??? question "Intro"

    **TRAITS**

    Hi, I'm KC from Taiwan. I'm a **data engineer** with over **three** years of experience. Thanks for having me.

    Before we dive deeper into the conversation, I felt it would be valuable to take a moment to **share a bit more about who I am, things that may not be obvious just from my resume**.

    - I would describe myself as a **self starter** who is willing to **take initiative and ownership of my work**.
    - I'm **comfortable navigating ambiguity** and **able to drive progress independently**.
    - I'm the kind of teammate **who is always happy to lift others up**.

    These qualities are **not just how I see myself**, my previous manager at TVBS, Aska, also described me in a similar way.

    He said I'm someone **who is very curious about everything**, that **I always get things done**, and that **I often push the team forward**.

    I think these traits really **reflect who I am**, and they're important to **how I work**. So I just wanted to quickly share them with you at the beginning.

    And my next 3 slides, I will share some of my work experience and personal projects that I think are relevant to this role.

    ---

    **TVBS**

    When I was working as a data engineer at TVBS, I had the opportunity to take the initiative on several impactful projects. 

    One of my most **impactful** projects is that **I led the redesign of our data architecture** using tools like Airbyte, BigQuery, dbt, and Airflow.
    
    We handled **terabytes of data daily** with **over 20 million events** from **massive amount of different sources**.
    
    Despite being a **lean data team of 6**, we **cut our data architecture costs by 63%** and delivered over 30 data products that empowered decision-making to **our internal users across 7 departments**.

    In order to deliver our data products in **a faster, more cost-effective and reliable way**, we also built **over 300 data models** and **over 600 data quality checks**.

    I think it's also worth mentioning that when we redesign our data architecture, we usually **keep the 4 principles of Data Mesh in mind**. That's because we believe **domain ownership** and **data product thinking** are especially important for larger organizations.

    **DATA LAKEHOUSE**

    In recent months, I also challenged myself with personal projects to explore technologies I wasn't yet familiar with.

    One of them was **building a real-time data lakehouse architecture using Debezium, Kafka, Iceberg, and Trino**. In this project, I set up a **fault-tolerant, scalable and real-time CDC data pipeline** that streams data from MySQL to Iceberg tables using Debezium and Kafka. Then I deployed and used Trino to query the Iceberg table that is stored in AWS S3.

    **CONCLUSION**

    Besides the two projects I just mentioned, I also worked on two more.
    
    One of them was during my time at TVBS, where I helped introduce **mParticle** and **Insider**. Through that experience, I gained some **basic knowledge of CDP as well as MarTech in general**.

    The other one is a personal project I built on my own, focusing on **MLOps**. I used several open-source tools to build a **real-time fraud detection system**, incorporating tools like **MLflow, Ray, KServe, Kubernetes, and Docker**.

    If any of these projects sound interesting, I'd be happy to dive deeper into them. Or if there's anything on my resume you'd like to discuss, I'm more than happy to talk about it.

    **MLOPS**

    Another project focused on real-time fraud detection, where I built an end-to-end MLOps pipeline using MLflow, Ray, and KServe. I also worked on handling imbalanced datasets and applied Bayesian optimization with Optuna, deploying the models through gRPC and REST APIs.


??? question "Tell me about TVBS"

    TVBS is the **leading media group** in Taiwan, with over **1,400 employees**. Around 60 of them work in software development.

    Every month, we have around **20 million users** visiting our website and mobile apps.

    We run more than **30 YouTube channels and over 30 Facebook pages**, covering a wide range of topics like news, food, cars, fashion, and health.

    On the international stage, TVBS has been recognized by the Reuters Institute at Oxford University. According to their reports, TVBS has been ranked as **the most trusted commercial TV news brand in Taiwan for 8 years in a row**, and **the most-used broadcast news media for 9 consecutive years**.


??? question "Why did you leave your last job?"

    My previous role was at **UST Global**, where I worked on a **server monitoring solution** for our client, Microsoft. I joined the project at the end of May. Unfortunately, in July, there was a **major global outage involving Microsoft's operating systems** which had a direct impact on our project.

    As a result, the project was **put on hold**. **There were plans to reassign me to another project**, but due to the overall situation at the time, that didn't happen. Eventually, **I decided to leave the company in September**.

    After that, I started seriously considering **working abroad**. I did a lot of research on **visa options** and decided to move to Canada because I've always wanted to live and **build a career there**. I arrived in early March, this year.

    But, shortly after landing, I found out that **my dad was diagnosed with cancer during a health checkup in March**. So I decided to **come back to Taiwan** to take care of him in early April.

    Between April and June, I focused on **supporting my family and managing household matters**. At the same time, I worked on several **personal projects** that I found quite challenging yet interesting and fulfilling.
    
    Thankfully, **my dad's health has improved during treatment**, and he's now recovering well.

    So **I thought it's the right time for me to re-enter the job market**.


??? question "What's your current employment status and notice period?"

    Right now, I'm **between jobs** and I have a **valid Canadian work permit** that allows me to work legally in Canada until next March, so I have about **7 to 8 months left**. After that, I would need **sponsorship** to continue working.

    And I also already have a **Canadian SIN number**, a **local bank account**, and a **Canadian phone number**. So once I receive an official job offer email, I can move to Canada and **start working within 2 weeks**. I also have friends there who can support me during the transition, so I don't see that as a problem.

??? question "What are you looking for in your next role?"

    In my next role, I'm mainly looking for two things.

    First, from a **personal and career** perspective, I hope to **build my career in Canada, especially in Vancouver**. I met some people from Canada who really encouraged me to explore opportunities in Canada. They shared **how diverse and beautiful the environment is**. After visiting once, I realized how much I really enjoy being in Vancouver. So I hope to **build a long-term life and career in Canada** as part of **my bigger life plan**. So **I'm open to any opportunities that can help me achieve that**.

    Second, in terms of the **role** itself, I hope to work on **scalability and reliability challenges**, projects that involve handling large-scale data and operating data platform reliably. I also **really enjoy diving into new areas**, especially if it's something I haven't worked with before, whether that's a new technology or a completely new domain. **I like the process of researching, learning, and solving problems from the ground up**.


??? question "Strength"

    I'd say my strengths fall into two main areas.

    First, from a **technical** perspective, I've shown that I can take the initiative and drive projects forward without needing much direction. Whether it's side projects or work-related tasks, I've been able to work independently and deliver results—even when I'm not familiar with 90% of the tools or concepts at the beginning. I enjoy figuring things out step by step and building complex systems from scratch.

    I also have a solid foundation in both machine learning and data engineering. For example, I've worked on projects involving CDP (Customer Data Platform) integration, used Kafka to move data from databases into a Lakehouse, and explored many areas in the ML and data space. So I'd say my technical range is quite broad and hands-on.

    Second, on the **personality** side, one of my biggest strengths is that **I'm comfortable working in uncertain or unclear situations and still getting things done**. **I love challanging myself**. But I don't just struggle on my own, **I actively reach out to others, ask questions, and then take ownership to follow through and deliver**.

    ---

    Actually, I often **get questioned about** whether my technical skills are strong enough, mainly because my past experience doesn't always clearly show deep technical expertise on paper. That's something I've been facing throughout my journey, whether it was during grad school, my internship, my first job, or even now.

    But I think one of my biggest strengths is that I **learn things really fast** and I'm someone who **takes initiative and actively figures out how to solve the problem**. Outside of work, **I also enjoy diving into new topics and exploring unfamiliar tools or technologies**. I really enjoy the process, especially when it's **something totally new or challenging**. I'm pretty comfortable with that kind of situation.

    For example, when I **introduced dbt at TVBS**, **hardly anyone in Taiwan was talking about it at the time**. No one on our team even knew what dbt was.

??? question "How did you introduce dbt at TVBS?"

    In the beginning, we tried to build a **Data Lakehouse architecture on AWS S3**, and we initially considered using **Apache Hudi**. We went through several versions of the architecture and tested it out, but we found **it was not feasible**. The main reason was that it created **a deeper technical barrier for the team**. Out of our six team members, four were data analysts who were not very familiar with the technical details, so maintaining the system became quite challenging.

    That's why we eventually decided to go with **dbt**. During the adoption process, we strongly believed that when introducing a new tool into a company, the most important thing is to **follow the principles of Agile or Scrum**. That means **every step should deliver clear business value**, and each step **should be small enough to be manageable**.
    
    When introducing new technologies, we also made sure that our architecture wouldn't be **overdesigned**. In other words, we aimed to build a **minimum viable architecture**, just enough to meet the core requirements without adding unnecessary complexity.

    Once we **start receiving feedback and people agree that we're heading in the right direction**, we can gradually continue adopting the new tool across the company. I also think **it's critical to have support or alignment from upper management**, as their **buy-in** makes the whole adoption process much **smoother**.

??? question "資料品質"

    To ensure data quality and avoid impacting downstream users or platform stability, we have processes in place at different stages.

    First, at the **upstream** level, meaning our app or website, although the Data Team is an independent team, **most of the data is actually generated by other Application Teams**. So if an Application Team makes a mistake during development, it can lead to issues in our downstream data and **this is a common challenge**.

    To address this, we try to **involve the Data Team as early as possible in their development process**, whether it's in meetings or during planning. **Early involvement gives us more context and allows us to identify potential issues before development starts**. In a way, this is similar to the concept of "**shifting left**" in testing, where we aim to **catch problems earlier to avoid bigger issues downstream**.

    Next, if despite these efforts, issues still occur once the data is generated, that brings us to the **midstream stage**. At this stage, we implement **extensive data testing using dbt**. For example, we validate that the final data products meet certain quality criteria, like ensuring that the age column doesn't have negative values, or that the number of orders in the past 14 days doesn't exceed a certain threshold. **These kinds of checks may trigger warnings, which we then investigate.**

    Finally, at the **downstream stage**, if issues still slip through and our internal users encounter data problems, we've set up **a feedback mechanism**. Different departments can manually query and **report issues directly to us, which allows us to respond quickly**. These reports feed into a **dedicated Slack channel**, where we also have **monitoring in place to alert us immediately if any ELT jobs fail or encounter anomalies**. This helps us react in real time and prevent issues from escalating.

??? question "Vague"

    When the PM gives me a project or a problem that's quite vague, **the first thing I always do is talk with the PM to understand where the request is coming from**. Specifically, **which end users it's meant to serve and what their needs or expectations are**.

    If things still remain unclear **after that initial discussion**, I'll usually **take the initiative to ask whether I can speak directly with the end users**. The reason is that I believe talking to them helps me **gain a much deeper understanding of the actual business requirements**. And once I have that context, **I can often come up with a better implementation plan**, **sometimes even identifying that the original direction might not be the most effective solution**.

    So overall, my approach is to **first clarify the context through communication**, and **then adjust the execution plan based on what I learn**. That way, I can make sure **I'm truly delivering what the company needs**.


??? question "What is SLI, SLO, SLA?"

    - SLI (Service Level Indicator) is a metric that quantifies how a service performs, such as request latency or availability rate.
    - SLO (Service Level Objective) is the target you set for an SLI. For example, 99.9% availability over 30 days.
    - SLA (Service Level Agreement) is a **formal, contractual commitment to an SLO**, often with penalties if breached.

    In short:
    
    - SLI: What you measure
    - SLO: What you aim for
    - SLA: What you legally commit to

??? question "Common Test"

    In general, we break software testing into a few common categories:

    - **Unit tests** check individual functions or components in isolation. Super fast and run locally.
    - **Integration tests** make sure multiple parts of the system work together, like a function calling an external API or DB.
    - **Regression tests** are basically any tests that **ensure old features still work after new changes**, usually just re-running the test suite.
    - **E2E tests** simulate real user behavior across the full system, like clicking buttons in a browser using tools like Cypress or Playwright
    - Other types include **load tests**, which check how the system performs under heavy load, and **smoke tests**, which are quick checks to see if the main features work after a deployment.

??? question "遠端工作、異地協作的經驗"

    I've had experience with remote work since my time at **TVBS**, so I'd say **I've adapted well to this way of working**.
    
    Later, at **UST Global**, I also collaborated **with teams based in Malaysia** and **with Microsoft teams in Seattle**, which gave me hands-on experience working across different time zones and locations.
    
    So yes, I'm familiar with both **remote work** and **cross-regional collaboration** and I actually enjoy working in this kind of setup.

??? question "Treasure Data Feeling"

    Thank you for being so **open** in sharing detailed information about the company.
    
    Throughout the interview process with Treasure Data, I really appreciated **how open and transparent everyone has been**, from Kelly, Ansel, to Akama and you. As a candidate, **that kind of openness is truly reassuring**. I really like the culture of **transparency and honesty** that Treasure Data promotes. **I really want to be part of a team member and make a contribution to the team**.

??? question "Ask"

    - **What qualities do you value the most in someone joining your team?**
    - **What's the most challenging thing your team face recently?**
    - **What is process after this meeting?**

    - What are some of the key strategic initiatives or growth directions in the near future? both company-wide and team-specific?

    - How does this team usually work with other teams? What does a typical cross-team collaboration look like?
    - Could you share what the typical collaboration process looks like between this team and other teams? For example, how do you usually align on goals or coordinate work?
    - I'm curious about how the Vancouver team collaborates with other teams, and also how you and I might potentially work together.

    - I know your company mainly uses technology A, so I'm curious — would you be interested in migrating to technology B?
    - Has there been any discussion within the company about migrating to Iceberg? Just curious — I'd love to hear your thoughts.


??? tip

    Thanks for sharing that. I really appreciate the clarity. **I believe those are also values I personally resonate with**.

    In my previous experiences, I've always strived to __________________________.
    
    So **I'd say this sounds like a great fit**, and I'd be excited to contribute in a way that aligns with what you're looking for.


??? tip

    That definitely sounds like a meaningful challenge — thanks for sharing.

    I've worked on similar situations before, especially around ______________, so **I can definitely see how I could add value here**.

    It's actually the kind of challenge **I'd be excited to help tackle**.
