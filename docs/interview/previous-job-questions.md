# Previous Job Questions

??? question "Why did you leave your last job?"

    My previous role was at UST Global, where I worked on a server monitoring solution for our client, Microsoft. I joined the project at the end of May. Unfortunately, in July, there was a major global outage involving Microsoft's operating systems—specifically on July 19th—which had a direct impact on our project.

    As a result, the project was put on hold. There were plans to reassign me to another project, but due to the overall situation at the time, that didn't happen. Eventually, I decided to company in September.

    After that, I started seriously considering working abroad. I did a lot of research on visa options and decided to move to Canada because I've always wanted to live and build a career there. I arrived in early March.

    However, shortly after landing—around the eighth day—I received news that my father had been diagnosed with cancer during a health checkup in March. I returned to Taiwan in early April to take care of him.

    Between April and June, I focused on supporting my family and managing household matters. At the same time, I worked on several personal projects that I found quite interesting and fulfilling. Thankfully, my father's health has improved significantly, and he's now recovering well.

    So I've decided it's the right time for me to re-enter the job market.

    To answer your question directly: I left my last job because I was laid off due to unforeseen project cancellation.


??? question "What's your current employment status and notice period?"

    I left my previous job in September last year. From September to March, I spent some time helping my family and handling personal matters. During that period, I was also preparing my Canadian work permit. After I got the permit, I flew to Canada in early March.

    Around mid-March, I found out that my father was diagnosed with cancer. So I just came back to Taiwan in early April to take care of him. While taking care of my dad, I also worked on some personal projects that I found interesting, challenging, and helpful for learning new technologies.

    From April to June, I continued to balance caregiving and side projects. Thankfully, my dad's condition has improved during treatment, so I now feel it's the right time to re-enter the job market. I started actively job hunting in July.

    Right now, I have a valid Canadian work permit that allows me to work legally in Canada until next March. I also have a Canadian SIN number and a local bank account, so once I receive an offer, I can move to Canada and start working within two weeks. I also have friends there who can support me during the transition, so I don't see that as a problem.


??? question "What are you looking for in your next role?"

    In my next role, I'm mainly looking for two things.

    First, in terms of the **role** itself, I hope to work on scalability challenges, projects that are technically challenging or involve large-scale data. I really enjoy diving into new areas, especially if it's something I haven't worked with before, whether that's a new technology or a completely new domain. I like the process of researching, learning, and solving problems from the ground up.

    Also, I'm really interested in areas like marketing technology and CDP, especially identity resolution and identity graphs. I had some hands-on experience with these topics when I helped TVBS introduce mParticle, so it's something I'd love to go deeper into.

    Second, from a **personal and career** perspective, I hope to build my career overseas, especially in Canada. Back when I was dancing, I met some people from Canada who really encouraged me to explore opportunities in Canada. They shared how diverse and beautiful the environment is, especially in Vancouver. After visiting once, I realized how much I really enjoy being in Vancouver. So I hope to build a long-term life and career in Vancouver as part of my bigger life plan. So I'm open to any opportunities that can help me achieve that.
