??? question "Intro"

    Hi I'm KC from Taiwan, Thanks for having me and I'm really excited to have this opportunity to interview with you today.
    
    I worked as a data engineer for over three years.

    I believe you've already seen my resume, so before we dive into the more technical parts or specific projects I've worked on, I'd like to take a moment to **share a bit more about myself, things that might not be obvious just from my resume**.

    I would describe myself as someone who truly enjoys challenging myself. Over the years, across different projects and stages of my career, I've consistently taken on work that pushed me outside of my comfort zone.

    During that time, I had the opportunity to take the initiative on several impactful projects. One of the most significant ones was at TVBS, a leading media company in Taiwan.

    When I was working there, I led the redesign of our data architecture using tools like BigQuery, dbt, Airbyte and Airflow . We handled terabytes of data daily with over 20 million events from massive amount of different sources. We also built over 300 data models and over 600 quality tests, supporting over 200 users across 7 departments. Despite being a lean data team of 6, we cut cloud costs by 63% and delivered over 30 data products that empowered decision-making across the organization.

    In recent months, I also challenged myself with personal projects to explore technologies I wasn't yet familiar with.

    One of them was **building a real-time data lakehouse using Debezium, Kafka, Iceberg, and Trino**. I set up CDC pipelines with exactly-once semantics.

    Another project focused on real-time fraud detection, where I built an end-to-end MLOps pipeline using MLflow, Ray, and KServe. I also worked on handling imbalanced datasets and applied Bayesian optimization with Optuna, deploying the models through gRPC and REST APIs.

    Back at TVBS, I was also involved in introducing mParticle CDP to the company. That was a really interesting experience where I learned a lot about user identities across different devices (ADID, IDFV, IDFA) and how identity resolution works in practice.

    If any of these projects sound interesting, I'd be happy to dive deeper into them. Or if there's anything on my resume you'd like to discuss, I'm more than happy to chat about it.

    I understand that **strong communication and collaboration** are especially important for this role. I just want to highlight that I really **enjoy working with others** and **being part of a team**. In my previous job, I consistently showed up, actively participated in team discussions, and made sure to stay aligned with everyone. My manager even described me as a reliable team player who always communicates clearly and takes initiative to support the team. If there are any concerns about collaboration, I'd be happy to share more examples of how I've worked closely with cross-functional teams in the past.


??? question "Why did you leave your last job?"

    My previous role was at **UST Global**, where I worked on a **server monitoring solution** for our client, Microsoft. I joined the project at the end of May. Unfortunately, in July, there was a **major global outage involving Microsoft's operating systems** which had a direct impact on our project.

    As a result, the project was **put on hold**. **There were plans to reassign me to another project**, but due to the overall situation at the time, that didn't happen. Eventually, **I decided to leave the company in September**.

    After that, I started seriously considering **working abroad**. I did a lot of research on **visa options** and decided to move to Canada because I've always wanted to live and **build a career there**. I arrived in early March.

    But, shortly after landing, I received news that **my dad had been diagnosed with cancer** during a health checkup in March. So I decided to **come back to Taiwan** to take care of him in early April.

    Between April and June, I focused on supporting my family and managing household matters. At the same time, I worked on several **personal projects** that I found quite challenging yet interesting and fulfilling. Thankfully, my dad's health has improved significantly, and he's now recovering well.

    So **I thought it's the right time for me to re-enter the job market**.

    To answer your question directly: I left my last job because I was laid off due to unforeseen project cancellation.


??? question "What's your current employment status and notice period?"

    I left my previous job in September last year. From September to March, I spent some time helping my family and handling personal matters. During that period, I was also preparing my Canadian work permit. After I got the permit, I flew to Canada in early March.

    Around mid-March, I found out that my father was diagnosed with cancer. So I just came back to Taiwan in early April to take care of him. While taking care of my dad, I also worked on some personal projects that I found interesting, challenging, and helpful for learning new technologies.

    From April to June, I continued to balance caregiving and side projects. Thankfully, my dad's condition has improved during treatment, so I now feel it's the right time to re-enter the job market. I started actively job hunting in July.

    Right now, I have a valid Canadian work permit that allows me to work legally in Canada until next March. I also have a Canadian SIN number and a local bank account, so once I receive an offer, I can move to Canada and start working within two weeks. I also have friends there who can support me during the transition, so I don't see that as a problem.


??? question "What are you looking for in your next role?"

    In my next role, I'm mainly looking for two things.

    First, in terms of the **role** itself, I hope to work on scalability challenges, projects that are technically challenging or involve large-scale data. I really enjoy diving into new areas, especially if it's something I haven't worked with before, whether that's a new technology or a completely new domain. I like the process of researching, learning, and solving problems from the ground up.

    Also, I'm really interested in areas like marketing technology and CDP, especially identity resolution and identity graphs. I had some hands-on experience with these topics when I helped TVBS introduce mParticle, so it's something I'd love to go deeper into.

    Second, from a **personal and career** perspective, I hope to build my career in Canada, especially in Vancouver. Back when I was dancing, I met some people from Canada who really encouraged me to explore opportunities in Canada. They shared how diverse and beautiful the environment is, especially in Vancouver. After visiting once, I realized how much I really enjoy being in Vancouver. So I hope to build a long-term life and career in Vancouver as part of my bigger life plan. So I'm open to any opportunities that can help me achieve that.

??? question "Tell me about TVBS"

    TVBS is the leading media group in Taiwan, with over 1,400 employees. Around 60 of them work in software development.

    Every month, we have around 20 million users visiting our website and mobile apps.

    We run more than 30 YouTube channels and over 30 Facebook pages, covering a wide range of topics like news, food, cars, entertainment, and health.

    On the international stage, TVBS has been recognized by the Reuters Institute at Oxford University. According to their Digital News Report 2025, TVBS has been ranked as the most trusted commercial TV news brand in Taiwan for eight years in a row, and the most-used broadcast news media for nine consecutive years.


??? question "Ask"

    1. What's the most challenging thing the team face recently?
    2. What is process after this meeting?
    3. What are the big things that your team is working on right now?
    4. What are some of the key strategic initiatives or growth directions in the near future? both company-wide and team-specific?
    5. How does this team usually work with other teams? What does a typical cross-team collaboration look like?


??? question "Strength"

    I'd say my strengths fall into two main areas.

    First, from a technical perspective, I've shown that I can take the initiative and drive projects forward without needing much direction. Whether it's side projects or work-related tasks, I've been able to work independently and deliver results—even when I'm not familiar with 90% of the tools or concepts at the beginning. I enjoy figuring things out step by step and building complex systems from scratch.

    I also have a solid foundation in both machine learning and data engineering. For example, I've worked on projects involving CDP (Customer Data Platform) integration, used Kafka to move data from databases into a Lakehouse, and explored many areas in the ML and data space. So I'd say my technical range is quite broad and hands-on.

    Second, on the personal side, one of my biggest strengths is that I love challenging myself. I'm comfortable working in uncertain or unclear situations and still getting things done. But I don't just struggle on my own—I actively reach out to others, ask questions, and then take ownership to follow through and deliver.

??? question "Product"


Actually, I often get questioned about whether my technical skills are strong enough, mainly because my past experience doesn't always clearly show deep technical expertise on paper. That's something I've been facing throughout my journey — whether it was during grad school, my first job, or even my internship.

But I think one of my biggest strengths is that I **learn really fast** and I'm someone who **takes initiative and actively figures out what the company needs me to learn** — and I just go for it. Outside of work, **I also enjoy diving into new topics and exploring unfamiliar tools or technologies**. I really enjoy the process, especially when it's something totally new or challenging. I'm pretty comfortable with that kind of situation.

For example, when I introduced the Modern Data Stack at TVBS, my manager actually told me that my thinking already felt like that of a senior data engineer. He said I was always thinking about how to build processes that the organization could keep benefiting from, and how to create long-term value for the business.
