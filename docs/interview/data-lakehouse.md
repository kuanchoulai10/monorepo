# Data Lakehouse Technical Interview Questions

## 1. What is a data lakehouse and how does it differ from traditional data lakes and data warehouses?

**Answer:** So a data lakehouse is essentially trying to get the best of both worlds - the flexibility of a data lake with the performance and ACID guarantees of a data warehouse. Traditional data lakes are great for storing massive amounts of raw data cheaply, but they lack schema enforcement and transaction support. Data warehouses give you that structure and performance but are expensive and not great with unstructured data. 

A lakehouse sits on top of your data lake storage - think S3 or ADLS - but adds a metadata layer that brings ACID transactions, schema evolution, and time travel capabilities. You're basically getting warehouse-like features while keeping your data in open formats like Parquet. The key is that metadata layer - it tracks all your table versions, handles concurrent writes, and maintains data quality without moving data around.

## 2. Explain Delta Lake and its core features.

**Answer:** Delta Lake is probably the most popular lakehouse implementation right now. At its core, it's an open-source storage layer that brings reliability to data lakes. The magic happens through transaction logs - every operation gets recorded in JSON files that act like a database log.

The big features are ACID transactions, so you can have multiple writers without corruption; time travel, where you can query any previous version of your data; and schema evolution, so you can safely add or modify columns. It also handles small file problems through automatic compaction and supports DML operations like updates and deletes, which raw Parquet can't do efficiently. The transaction log is really the secret sauce - it's how Delta knows what files belong to what version of the table and ensures consistency.

## 3. How does the medallion architecture work in a lakehouse?

**Answer:** The medallion architecture is a design pattern with three layers - bronze, silver, and gold. Think of it as a data refinement pipeline. Bronze is your raw ingestion layer - you're basically landing data as-is from source systems, minimal transformation, just getting it into your lakehouse quickly. This gives you that safety net where you never lose the original data.

Silver is where you start cleaning and conforming - deduplication, data quality checks, maybe some light transformations. You're creating a cleaner, more reliable dataset but still keeping it fairly atomic. Gold is your business-ready layer - aggregated metrics, joined datasets, whatever your downstream consumers need.

The beauty is each layer serves different use cases. Data scientists might work in silver for exploration, while executives get their dashboards from gold. And since it's all in the lakehouse, you're not duplicating data or managing complex ETL between systems.

## 4. What are the challenges of implementing ACID transactions in a data lake environment?

**Answer:** The biggest challenge is that traditional data lakes use object storage like S3, which doesn't have built-in transactional capabilities. You can't just lock files like you would in a database. So you need to build consistency on top of eventually consistent storage, which is tricky.

Concurrent writes are a nightmare - if two processes try to modify the same table simultaneously, you can end up with corrupted state or lost data. That's why solutions like Delta Lake use optimistic concurrency control with transaction logs. But even then, you're dealing with retry logic and conflict resolution.

Performance is another issue - maintaining transaction logs and metadata can add overhead, especially for small frequent writes. And schema evolution gets complex when you're trying to maintain backwards compatibility across different versions of your data. The key is having a robust metadata layer that can handle all this complexity while keeping the interface simple for users.

## 5. How do you handle schema evolution in a lakehouse architecture?

**Answer:** Schema evolution in a lakehouse is all about managing changes without breaking downstream consumers. The metadata layer tracks schema versions, so when someone adds a new column, it doesn't invalidate existing data or queries.

There are different types of evolution - additive changes like new columns are usually safe, but removing or renaming columns can break things. Good lakehouse implementations support schema merging, where new data with additional fields gets automatically incorporated. You also get type evolution, like promoting integers to longs.

The transaction log is crucial here - it records not just data changes but schema changes too. Tools like Delta Lake let you enforce schema on write or evolve schema automatically. Time travel becomes super valuable because you can always go back to a previous schema version if something breaks. The key is having clear governance around who can make schema changes and testing downstream impacts before deploying.

## 6. What is the role of metadata management in a lakehouse?

**Answer:** Metadata is absolutely critical - it's what turns a data swamp into a usable lakehouse. You've got technical metadata like schema, partitioning, and file locations, but also business metadata like data lineage, ownership, and quality metrics.

The metadata layer needs to handle discovery - users should be able to find relevant datasets without knowing exactly where they live. It tracks data lineage so you understand dependencies and can assess impact of changes. Version control is huge too - knowing what changed, when, and who changed it.

Modern lakehouses use catalogs like Hive Metastore, AWS Glue, or Unity Catalog to centralize this. But you also need governance - data classification, access controls, retention policies. The metadata layer essentially makes your lakehouse self-documenting and governable. Without it, you're back to the data lake problem where data exists but nobody knows what it means or if they can trust it.

## 7. How do you optimize query performance in a data lakehouse?

**Answer:** Query optimization in a lakehouse starts with smart partitioning - organizing your data by frequently filtered columns like date or region. This eliminates unnecessary file scanning. File sizing is crucial too - too many small files kill performance, so you need compaction strategies.

Columnar formats like Parquet are essential for analytical workloads since you only read the columns you need. Adding statistics and zone maps helps query engines skip irrelevant files entirely. Some lakehouses support bloom filters for high-cardinality lookups.

Caching is huge - both result caching and data caching. Tools like Databricks have disk caching that persists between queries. Indexing is evolving too - Delta Lake recently added liquid clustering which is like dynamic partitioning.

The compute engine matters a lot - vectorized execution, code generation, predicate pushdown. And don't forget about data layout optimization - techniques like Z-ordering can dramatically improve performance for multi-dimensional queries. The key is understanding your query patterns and optimizing accordingly.

## 8. What are the main data ingestion patterns for lakehouses?

**Answer:** There are several ingestion patterns depending on your needs. Batch ingestion is still common - think daily ETL jobs pulling from operational systems. You're usually landing data in bronze first, then processing through your medallion layers.

Real-time streaming is becoming huge though. Tools like Kafka, Kinesis, or Pulsar feed directly into your lakehouse. The trick is handling late-arriving data and maintaining exactly-once semantics. Change data capture is really powerful here - capturing database changes and streaming them in near real-time.

Micro-batching is a middle ground - processing small batches frequently instead of large batches daily. And don't forget about API ingestion for SaaS systems or file-based ingestion for things like CSV uploads.

The architecture usually involves landing zones for raw data, then transformation layers. Auto-loader patterns are popular where new files trigger processing automatically. The key is designing for both throughput and reliability while maintaining data quality throughout the pipeline.

## 9. How do you ensure data quality and governance in a lakehouse environment?

**Answer:** Data quality in a lakehouse requires a multi-layered approach. First, you implement schema enforcement at ingestion - reject or quarantine data that doesn't match expected formats. Great Expectations or similar frameworks can validate data against business rules before it enters your silver layer.

Lineage tracking is crucial - you need to know where data came from and where it's going. This helps with impact analysis and root cause investigation when quality issues arise. Data contracts between teams help set clear expectations about data formats and SLAs.

Access controls are fundamental - use role-based permissions and attribute-based access control to ensure people only see what they should. Tools like Unity Catalog provide fine-grained security down to the column level. Data classification helps identify sensitive information automatically.

Monitoring is key - track things like data freshness, completeness, and statistical distributions. Set up alerts for anomalies. And don't forget about data retention policies and right-to-be-forgotten compliance. The goal is building trust through transparency and reliability.

## 10. What are the key considerations when choosing between different lakehouse platforms?

**Answer:** Platform choice really depends on your existing ecosystem and requirements. If you're already in AWS, something like Lake Formation with Delta Lake on EMR might make sense. Azure users often go with Synapse Analytics or Databricks on Azure.

Consider your compute needs - do you need auto-scaling for variable workloads? How important is multi-language support? Some teams need SQL-only interfaces while others want Python and Scala support. Performance requirements matter too - some platforms optimize better for specific query patterns.

Open standards are increasingly important - can you avoid vendor lock-in? Delta Lake, Iceberg, and Hudi are all open source, which gives you portability. But proprietary features might offer better performance or ease of use.

Cost structure varies significantly - some charge by compute time, others by storage, some have complex pricing models. Factor in not just raw costs but operational overhead. How much engineering effort will it take to maintain? What's the learning curve for your team? Sometimes paying more for a managed service saves money in the long run.
