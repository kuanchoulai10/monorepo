# Introduce Myself


Hi, I'm KC from Taiwan. I'm a data Engineer with over three years of experience. 

After my last conversation with Kelly, I learned a bit about the previous person in this role, I felt it would be valuable to take a moment to share a bit more about who I am, things that may not be obvious from my resume.


These qualities are not just how I see myself,

My previous manager at TVBS also described me in a similar way.

He said I'm someone who's very curious about everything, that I always get things done, and that I often push the team forward.

I think these traits really reflect who I am, and they're important to how I work. So I just wanted to quickly share them with you at the beginning.


And next 3 slides, I will share some of my work experience and projects that I think are relevant to this role.

When I was working as a data engineer at TVBS, one of my most impactful projects is that I led the redesign of our data architecture, managing daily data processing at TB+ scale, handling over 20 million events per day from 4 to 9+ data sources. The platform we built supported over 200 users across 7 domain teams through a centralized dashboard system.

I think it's worth mentioning that when we design our data architecture, we usually keep the four principles of Data Mesh in mind. That's because we believe domain ownership and data product thinking are especially important for larger organizations.

Despite a lean data team of 6, we successfully reduced cloud infrastructure costs by 63% through architectural optimization and careful pipeline tuning.


I've actually been looking into this recently. If you're interested, I can share more information with you.


- I know your company mainly uses technology A, so I'm curious — would you be interested in migrating to technology B?
- Has there been any discussion within the company about migrating to Iceberg? Just curious — I'd love to hear your thoughts.
- Could you share what the typical collaboration process looks like between this team and other teams? For example, how do you usually align on goals or coordinate work?
- I'm curious about how the Vancouver team collaborates with other teams, and also how you and I might potentially work together.
