# Introduce Myself


Hi, I'm KC from Taiwan. I'm a data and machine learning engineer with over three years of experience. My focus is on building scalable and reliable data pipelines and Machine Learning platform by applying both DataOps and MLOps best practices.

When I was working as a data engineer at TVBS, one of my most impactful projects is that I led the redesign of our data architecture, managing daily data processing at TB+ scale, handling over 20 million events per day from 4 to 9+ data sources. The platform we built supported over 200 users across 7 domain teams through a centralized dashboard system.

Despite a lean team of only 6 full-time data analysts and engineers, we successfully reduced cloud infrastructure costs by 63% through architectural optimization and careful pipeline tuning.

Despite a lean team of just six people, we reduced cloud costs by 63% through architectural optimization. This project laid the groundwork for DataOps practices, enabling faster iteration, better governance, and increased trust in data across the company.
