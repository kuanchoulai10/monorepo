!!! question "What is Count-Min Sketch?"

    ??? tip "Answer"

        Count-Min Sketch is a probabilistic data structure used to estimate the frequency of elements in a data stream using sublinear space. It trades off accuracy for memory efficiency.

        It works by hashing each incoming element with multiple hash functions and incrementing corresponding counters in a 2D array. To estimate the frequency of an element, it takes the **minimum** count across all its hash positionsâ€”hence the name. It's commonly used for approximate counting in streaming systems, like estimating top-k queries or detecting heavy hitters.
