# Indexing

!!! question "What is Geohashing?"

    ??? tip "Answer"
    
        Geohashing is a method of encoding geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) into a compact string representation. It divides the world into a grid of cells, each identified by a unique alphanumeric code. This allows for efficient spatial indexing and querying of geographic data.


!!! question "What is Quadtree?"

    ??? tip "Answer"
    
        A quadtree is a tree data structure used to partition a two-dimensional space by recursively subdividing it into four quadrants or regions. It is commonly used for spatial indexing, allowing efficient storage and retrieval of spatial data, such as points, rectangles, or polygons. Each node in the quadtree represents a region of space, and its children represent subdivisions of that region.
