# 📆 May 2025 — Monthly Learning Summary

## 🚀 Highlight of the Month
Summarize your biggest breakthrough, project, or insight in 1–2 sentences.

> Example: This month I successfully integrated Feast + MLflow + KServe on Kubernetes. It helped me better understand how to connect data pipelines with real-time model serving.


## 📥 Input – What I Consumed
A list of articles, papers, courses, or videos you read/watched.

- Read: "Multi-Tenant Architecture at Netflix"
- Watched: Ray Tune Hyperparameter Optimization tutorial on YouTube
- Completed: Introduction to Kubernetes by Learnk8s


## 📤 Output – What I Created or Tried
What you built, experimented with, or implemented.

- Set up an end-to-end MLOps pipeline using SQLMesh + Feast + MLflow + KServe
- Experimented with MinIO as an S3-compatible object store on Kubernetes
- Published a blog post: “How to Productionize ML with Feast + KServe” (link)


## 📚 Key Takeaways – What I Learned
Short reflections on what you actually learned or became more confident in.

- Gained confidence in configuring Helm charts for K8s services
- Learned how gRPC v2 protocol works in KServe’s transformer module
- Understood the benefits of separating data projects in SQLMesh


## 💭 Reflections – Beyond Just Tech
Soft-skill insights or workflow/communication/process reflections.

- Noticed that sharing architecture early improved cross-team alignment
- Realized that focusing on “getting it to work” first is better than early optimization
- Started taking short daily notes to reduce context switching fatigue


## 🔭 Goals for Next Month
Set 2–3 simple goals to stay focused and accountable.

- Explore Apache Beam for real-time data processing
- Write and publish a short piece on multi-project setup with SQLMesh
- Try integrating Prometheus + Grafana for model monitoring
