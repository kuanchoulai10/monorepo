# May 2025

## Highlight of the Month
Summarize my biggest breakthrough, project, or insight in this month:

> *This month I mainly focused on my side project [Fraud Detection: From DataOps to MLOps](../side-projects/data2ml-ops/index.md), and successfully integrated lots of interesting tools I've never tried before, like Feast, MLflow, Ray and KServe! It helped me better understand how to connect data pipelines with real-time model serving and got so much fun during the process.*


## What I Consumed

## What I Created or Tried
What I built, experimented with, or wrote:

- [x] Set up an end-to-end Data2MLOps pipeline using dbt, Feast, MLflow, Ray and KServe.
- [x] Published a series of posts on my side project [Fraud Detection: From DataOps to MLOps](../side-projects/data2ml-ops/index.md).
- [x] Tried out multi-stage Docker builds with `uv` to optimize my Python environment setup.
- [x] Experimented with MinIO as an S3-compatible object store on Kubernetes.
- [x] Tried out GitHub Copilot's configuraiton [best practices](https://github.com/doggy8088/github-copilot-configs) and its agent mode for more efficient coding.


## What I Learned
Short reflections on what I actually learned or became more confident in:

- [x] Grasped how **multi-stage Docker builds** work and how they can significantly reduce image size and build time
- [x] Deepened my understanding of how **Ray Tune** integrates with **Optuna** to perform distributed hyperparameter tuning, enhancing both speed and efficiency in machine learning tasks
- [x] Learned **the pros and cons between REST API and gRPC** for model serving, and how to use **KServe** to deploy models with both protocols


## Reflections - Beyond Just Tech
Soft-skill insights or workflow/communication/process reflections:

- [x] Recognized that in the AI era, mastering individual tools is easy, but engineers add value by **excelling in multi-tool integration and architectural design**.
- [x] Realized that relying solely on LLMs for poorly documented tools can lead to inefficiencies. It's crucial to **combine LLM assistance with thorough manual exploration and testing**.
- [x] Noticed that **GitHub Copilot** can significantly speed up coding, but it requires careful management to avoid code quality issues.


## Goals for Next Month
Set 2–3 simple goals to stay focused and accountable:

- [ ] Explore **Airflow 3.0** and its new features.
- [ ] Try building my first **MCP server**.
- [ ] Accelarate my developer experience with **GitHub Copilot** and its agent mode.
- [ ] Write and publish my thoughts on why I use `mkdocs-material` for my blog and how I set it up.
