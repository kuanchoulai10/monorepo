# Disaster Recovery with Apache Iceberg


- The Catalog Is Missing or Points to the Wrong `metadata.json` --> `register_table` to re-establish the link to your latest `metadata.json`.
- File Paths Have Changed During Restore --> use `rewrite_table_path` to rewrite metadata and create a clean recovery copy


## Best Practices for Iceberg Disaster Recovery

Implement proactive backup practices

- Always Backup Metadata and Data Together
- Track the Latest `metadata.json` in Every Backup
- Check for File Path Changes Before Recovery
- Automate Validation Post-Restore
- Dry-Run Your Recovery Plan
