# Learning in Progress

Staying curious is at the core of how I grow. I embrace challenges as chances to learn, document progress, and connect with others who share a passion for discovery.

This roadmap keeps me accountable while inspiring others to start their own learning journeys. By sharing tools and insights, I aim to contribute to a community of lifelong learners eager to grow together.
