- [x] [愛好 AI Engineer 電子報 🚀 模型上下文協定 MCP 應用開發 #27](https://ihower.tw/blog/archives/12744)
    - I really liked how the author described two different ways of building agents: one that relies on a customizable framework, and another that's more lightweight and built using just the core features of the programming language. It instantly reminded me of the old debates between TensorFlow 1.0 and PyTorch.
    - After reading this article, I realized that the strength of senior engineers lies in their ability to quickly pick up new technologies and analyze different approaches logically with their own keen insights. This is a skill that I aspire to develop.
- [ ] [Featurestore at Agoda: How We Optimized Dragonfly for High-Performance Caching](https://medium.com/agoda-engineering/featurestore-at-agoda-how-we-optimized-dragonfly-for-high-performance-caching-4d28c584f612)
- [x] [How Agoda manages 1.8 trillion Events per day on Kafka](https://medium.com/agoda-engineering/how-agoda-manages-1-8-trillion-events-per-day-on-kafka-1d6c3f4a7ad1)
    - 2-step logging approach.
    - Multiple smaller Kafka clusters instead of 1 Large Kafka cluster per Data Center
    - Agoda employs a robust Kafka auditing system by aggregating message counts via background threads in client libraries, routing audits to a dedicated Kafka cluster, and implementing monitoring and alerting mechanisms for audit messages.
    - Agoda calculates cluster capacity by comparing each resource’s usage against its upper limit and taking the highest percentage to represent the dominant constraint at that moment.
    - Agoda attributes cost back to teams, which transformed team mindsets, driving proactive cost management and accountability across Agoda
    - The new auth system empowers the Kafka team to control access, manage credentials, and protect sensitive data through fine-grained ACLs
    - Operational scalability is ensured through automated tooling that streamlines and simplifies system management.
- [x] [Scaling Kafka to Support PayPal’s Data Growth](https://medium.com/paypal-tech/scaling-kafka-to-support-paypals-data-growth-a0b4da420fab)
    - Cluster Management: Kafka Config Service, ACLs, PayPal Kafka Libraries, QA Environment

- [ ] [Vortex: A Stream-oriented Storage Engine For Big Data Analytics](https://research.google/pubs/vortex-a-stream-oriented-storage-engine-for-big-data-analytics/)
- [x] [DuckLake: SQL as a Lakehouse Format](https://duckdb.org/2025/05/27/ducklake.html)
    - It simplifies lakehouses by using a standard SQL database for all metadata while still storing data in open formats like Parquet, just like BigQuery with Spanner and Snowflake with FoundationDB.

    - Five primitives of MCP: resources, tools, prompts, roots and sampling.
