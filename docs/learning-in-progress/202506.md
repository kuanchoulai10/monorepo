## What I Consumed
A list of articles, papers, courses, or videos I read/watched/completed:

### Read

- [x] [Pyright 上手指南：Python 型別檢查的新選擇](https://blog.kyomind.tw/pyright/)
- [ ] [Data versioning as your ‘Get out of jail’ card – DVC vs. Git-LFS vs. dolt vs. lakeFS](https://lakefs.io/blog/dvc-vs-git-vs-dolt-vs-lakefs/)
- [ ] [Unity Catalog | GitHub](https://github.com/unitycatalog/unitycatalog)
- [ ] [Exploring the Architecture of Apache Iceberg, Delta Lake, and Apache Hudi](https://www.dremio.com/blog/exploring-the-architecture-of-apache-iceberg-delta-lake-and-apache-hudi/)
- [ ] [Hudi vs Iceberg vs Delta Lake: Data Lake Table Formats Compared](https://lakefs.io/blog/hudi-iceberg-and-delta-lake-data-lake-table-formats-compared/)
- [ ] [Big Metadata: When Metadata is Big Data](https://research.google/pubs/big-metadata-when-metadata-is-big-data/)
- [ ] [Vortex: A Stream-oriented Storage Engine For Big Data Analytics](https://research.google/pubs/vortex-a-stream-oriented-storage-engine-for-big-data-analytics/)
- [x] [DuckLake: SQL as a Lakehouse Format](https://duckdb.org/2025/05/27/ducklake.html)
    - It simplifies lakehouses by using a standard SQL database for all metadata while still storing data in open formats like Parquet, just like BigQuery with Spanner and Snowflake with FoundationDB.
- [ ] [GitHub MCP Exploited: Accessing private repositories via MCP](https://invariantlabs.ai/blog/mcp-github-vulnerability)


### Watched


- [x] [Introducing Pyrefly: A new type checker and IDE experience for Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXaFRKrTJVU)
- [ ] [Tampa Bay DE Meetup: The Who, What and Why of Data Lake Table Formats (Iceberg, Hudi, Delta Lake)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eEcWopaFqE)
- [ ] [Watch a Complete NOOB Try DuckDB and DuckLake for the first time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_tgEBaEDf0)
- [ ] [Introducing DuckLake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeonmOO9jm4)
    - Next Steps: the ability to import and export from existing lakehouse formats like Iceberg and the ability to talk to more databases.
- [x] [Why build Event-Driven AI systems?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3tWgpIZemg)
- [x] [Why MCP really is a big deal.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLpS7OfD5-s)
    - MCP offers pluggable, discoverable, and composable solutions that simplify complex integrations.
- [x] [Why Everyone’s Talking About MCP?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_d0duu3dED4)
    - It addresses the issue faced by $M$ AI vendors, where implementing $N$ tools results in an $M \times N$ complexity problem. Instead, it simplifies the problem to an $M+N$ complexity solution.
    - Five primitives of MCP: resources, tools, prompts, roots and sampling.

### Completed Courses

## What I Created or Tried
What I built, experimented with, or implemented:

- [ ] Experimented with [Pyrefly](https://pyrefly.org/)
- [x] Experimented with [Speechify](https://speechify.com/)
    - I really like the ability to listen to articles and papers while doing other tasks. It helps me consume more content without feeling overwhelmed. What I like the most is that they have Snoop Dogg as a voice option, which adds a fun twist to the experience! Could you imagine listening to a data lakehouse article narrated by Snoop Dogg? ☠️
- [ ] Experimented with [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) and [DuckLake](https://ducklake.select/)
- [ ] Experimented with [FastMCP v2](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp)
- [ ] Experimented with [`kubectl-ai`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubectl-ai)
