### Read

- [ ] [Featurestore at Agoda: How We Optimized Dragonfly for High-Performance Caching](https://medium.com/agoda-engineering/featurestore-at-agoda-how-we-optimized-dragonfly-for-high-performance-caching-4d28c584f612)
- [x] [How Agoda manages 1.8 trillion Events per day on Kafka](https://medium.com/agoda-engineering/how-agoda-manages-1-8-trillion-events-per-day-on-kafka-1d6c3f4a7ad1)
    - 2-step logging approach.
    - Multiple smaller Kafka clusters instead of 1 Large Kafka cluster per Data Center
    - Agoda employs a robust Kafka auditing system by aggregating message counts via background threads in client libraries, routing audits to a dedicated Kafka cluster, and implementing monitoring and alerting mechanisms for audit messages.
    - Agoda calculates cluster capacity by comparing each resource’s usage against its upper limit and taking the highest percentage to represent the dominant constraint at that moment.
    - Agoda attributes cost back to teams, which transformed team mindsets, driving proactive cost management and accountability across Agoda
    - The new auth system empowers the Kafka team to control access, manage credentials, and protect sensitive data through fine-grained ACLs
    - Operational scalability is ensured through automated tooling that streamlines and simplifies system management.
- [x] [Scaling Kafka to Support PayPal’s Data Growth](https://medium.com/paypal-tech/scaling-kafka-to-support-paypals-data-growth-a0b4da420fab)
    - Cluster Management: Kafka Config Service, ACLs, PayPal Kafka Libraries, QA Environment
    - Monitoring and Alerting
    - Configuration Management

- [x] [DuckLake: SQL as a Lakehouse Format](https://duckdb.org/2025/05/27/ducklake.html)
    - It simplifies lakehouses by using a standard SQL database for all metadata while still storing data in open formats like Parquet, just like BigQuery with Spanner and Snowflake with FoundationDB.

- [ ] [Introducing DuckLake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeonmOO9jm4)
    - Next Steps: the ability to import and export from existing lakehouse formats like Iceberg and the ability to talk to more databases.
- [x] [Why build Event-Driven AI systems?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3tWgpIZemg)
- [x] [Why MCP really is a big deal.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLpS7OfD5-s)
    - MCP offers pluggable, discoverable, and composable solutions that simplify complex integrations.
- [x] [Why Everyone’s Talking About MCP?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_d0duu3dED4)
    - It addresses the issue faced by $M$ AI vendors, where implementing $N$ tools results in an $M \times N$ complexity problem. Instead, it simplifies the problem to an $M+N$ complexity solution.
    - Five primitives of MCP: resources, tools, prompts, roots and sampling.
