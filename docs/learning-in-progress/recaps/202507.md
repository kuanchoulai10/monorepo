# July 2025

## Highlight of the Month
Summarize my biggest breakthrough, project, or insight in this month:

> *This month, I've been focusing on system design practice, and it's been an incredibly valuable experience. Preparing for these interviews has helped me strengthen my ability to break down ambiguous problems, structure my thoughts clearly, and communicate trade-offs effectively. Most importantly, I've started to think more like a systems thinker — considering scalability, availability, and reliability in every decision.*

## Reflections – Beyond Just Tech
Soft-skill insights or workflow/communication/process reflections:

- This month I had interviews with three companies. While my resume optimization has been effective in getting me to the interview stage, **my actual capabilities still need improvement to secure job offers**.
    - The first company (Dcard) was for a **Data Engineer** position, where I was tested on **OOP concepts** and asked to **design a queue class**. My implementation skills need strengthening, particularly in using abstract classes and interfaces.
    - The second company (Houzz) was for a **Data Infra Engineer** role. The third round focused on **Spark and Airflow system architecture and optimization strategies**. I realized I need to deepen my understanding of system component operations and optimization methods.
    - The third company (Treasure Data) was for a **Data Engineer** position where dbt is heavily used internally. I reached the fourth round's **behavioral interview** but was completely unprepared for English behavioral interviews and was eliminated. This made me realize that beyond technical skills, behavioral interview preparation is crucial, especially for English interviews.
- When preparing for interviews, **I can't afford to be selective**. **I must comprehensively improve all my capabilities.**
